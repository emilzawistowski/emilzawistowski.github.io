## Project Overview

Complete sound post-production for *Echoes of Industry*, a 78-minute documentary exploring the decline of manufacturing in post-industrial European cities. The film combines archival footage, contemporary interviews, and observational sequences to examine economic transformation and community resilience.

**Director:** Maria Kowalska  
**Production Company:** Dokumenta Films  
**Duration:** 78 minutes  
**Format:** DCP (5.1 surround), Stereo (broadcast)  
**Completion:** February 2024  
**Role:** Sound Designer, Dialogue Editor, Re-recording Mixer

## Creative Brief

The director's vision emphasized:
- **Authentic soundscapes** that reflected both past and present industrial environments
- **Minimal music** to preserve observational documentary style
- **Immersive 5.1 mix** for theatrical release
- **Archival audio restoration** that respected historical character while improving intelligibility

## Sound Design Approach

### Concept: Temporal Layering

The sound design used layered acoustic environments to represent the passage of time and economic change:

- **Archival sequences (1970s-80s):** Factory ambiences, machinery, worker conversations
- **Contemporary scenes (2020s):** Quiet, abandoned spaces with environmental sounds
- **Transitions:** Sonic bridges between past and present using factory sounds that fade and transform

### Source Recording

**Field Recording Sessions:**
- 5 days recording in abandoned factories (authentic reverb and acoustic spaces)
- Machinery sounds from operating factories (reference for archival scenes)
- Contemporary urban ambiences in post-industrial neighborhoods
- Specific locations: Łódź, Katowice, Berlin, Manchester

**Equipment:**
- Sound Devices 833 recorder
- DPA 4006A stereo pair
- Sennheiser MKH 416 shotgun
- Contact mics for structural resonances
- Ambisonics microphone (Røde NT-SF1) for spatial environments

## Workflow & Technical Process

### Dialogue Editing (3 weeks)

**Interviews (28 participants):**
- Recorded on location with varying quality
- Noise reduction using iZotope RX 10 (spectral repair, de-noise, de-reverb)
- Consistent tonal balance across different recording conditions
- Subtitle sync and quality control

**Archival Audio:**
- Restoration of degraded 16mm magnetic track
- Spectral repair of scratches and dropouts
- Hum removal while preserving character
- Matching EQ to contemporary dialogue

### Sound Effects & Ambiences

**Library:**
- Custom recorded factory ambiences
- Historical machinery sounds (recorded at technical museum)
- Environmental backgrounds for each location

**Spotting & Layering:**
- 4-8 layers per scene for depth and realism
- Spatial positioning in 5.1 surround
- Dynamic evolution (machines starting, running, stopping)
- Silence used intentionally in abandoned space sequences

### Music Integration

**Composer Collaboration:**
- Worked with composer Piotr Nowak on 3 original pieces
- Sparse score emphasizing strings and prepared piano
- Music editing and stem management
- Seamless integration with sound design elements

**Music Cues:**
- Opening: Slow piano piece establishing mood (3:15)
- Mid-film: String quartet during archival montage (4:30)
- Closing: Gradual orchestral build to resolution (5:45)

### 5.1 Surround Mix

**Spatial Strategy:**

**Front Channels (L, C, R):**
- Dialogue primarily centered
- Key sound effects and foreground elements
- Music spreads across front soundstage

**Surround Channels (Ls, Rs):**
- Environmental ambiences
- Factory reverb and room tone
- Immersive spatial elements (machinery moving around space)
- Historical/contemporary differentiation through surround use

**LFE:**
- Heavy machinery low-frequency extension
- Structural rumbles in factory scenes
- Subtle support for emotional moments

### Mixing Console & DAW

- **DAW:** Reaper (fully customized template)
- **Monitoring:** Genelec 8351 (LCR) + 8340 (surrounds) + 7370 sub
- **Room:** Calibrated to SMPTE standards
- **Plugins:** FabFilter Pro-Q3, iZotope RX, Waves Renaissance suite
- **Metering:** Nugen VisLM for broadcast compliance

   - Individual music stems for re-licensing

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Archival Audio Quality

**Problem:** Some 1970s factory footage had severe magnetic stripe degradation

**Solution:**
- Spectral repair in iZotope RX to remove clicks and hum
- Strategic use of contemporary factory recordings to fill gaps
- Preserved authentic quality while ensuring intelligibility
- Re-recorded select dialogue with actors when original was unusable

### Challenge 2: Authentic Factory Soundscapes

**Problem:** Creating believable 1970s-80s factory ambiences from modern sources

**Solution:**
- Research into period-specific machinery
- Recording at technical museum with operational vintage equipment
- Layering techniques to build complex, believable soundscapes
- Avoiding modern digital machinery sounds

### Challenge 3: Emotional Balance

**Problem:** Supporting narrative without over-dramatizing documentary content

**Solution:**
- Restraint in music use (only 13 minutes in 78-minute film)
- Silence as powerful tool in abandoned factory sequences
- Sound design that felt real rather than designed
- Director collaboration on every mixing decision
