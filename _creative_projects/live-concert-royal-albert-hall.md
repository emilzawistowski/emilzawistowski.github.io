## Project Overview

Front of house sound engineering for the London Symphony Orchestra's contemporary classical music program at Royal Albert Hall, featuring world premieres of works by living composers alongside 20th-century classics.

**Date:** November 15, 2023  
**Venue:** Royal Albert Hall, London (5,272 capacity)  
**Role:** Front of House Engineer  
**Client:** London Symphony Orchestra  
**Audience:** 4,800 attendees

## Program

**Contemporary Works:**
- World premiere: Anna Thorvaldsdottir — "Archora" (22 minutes)
- UK premiere: Caroline Shaw — "Is a Rose" (15 minutes)
- Kaija Saariaho — "Nymphéa" (2003, 35 minutes)

**Orchestra:** London Symphony Orchestra (90 musicians)  
**Conductor:** Esa-Pekka Salonen  
**Soloists:** Soprano Clara Laurent, Electronics by Ensemble Signal

## Technical Challenge

This concert presented unique sound reinforcement challenges:
1. **Acoustic vs. Amplified Balance** — Integrating live electronics with unamplified orchestra in a reverberant space
2. **Spatial Audio** — Thorvaldsdottir's piece required 8-channel surround sound
3. **Dynamic Range** — Preserving the extreme quietness and power of orchestral performance
4. **Historical Venue** — Working within Royal Albert Hall's acoustic limitations

## Technical Setup

### Microphone Plan

**Orchestra Sections:**
- **Strings:** 12× DPA 4006A (spaced pair per section)
- **Woodwinds:** 8× Schoeps MK4 spot mics
- **Brass:** 6× Sennheiser MKH 416 distant mics
- **Percussion:** 4× AKG C414 overheads + spot mics as needed
- **Main Arrays:** Decca tree (3× Neumann M50) + outriggers

**Soloists:**
- Soprano: DPA 4088 headset mic
- Electronics: Direct feeds from Ableton Live playback

### Mixing Console & Processing

- **Console:** DiGiCo SD7 (96 inputs, 48kHz)
- **Processing:** Waves L2 multiband limiting, subtle EQ on orchestral sections
- **Reverb:** Lexicon 960L (hall program for electronics integration)
- **Spatial Processor:** d&b Soundscape for 8-channel piece

### Speaker System

- **Main PA:** d&b audiotechnik GSL line array (16 boxes per side)
- **Surround:** d&b Y-series for immersive piece (8 positions around hall)
- **Front fills:** d&b V-series for front rows
- **Delays:** Upper gallery delay system synchronized
- **Subwoofers:** Minimal use, only for electronic elements (4× d&b B22)

## Rehearsal Process

### Day 1: Orchestra Load-in & Mic Check
- 8 hours: Microphone placement and orchestral balance
- Worked closely with conductor on reinforcement level
- Established "transparent" sound that enhanced rather than replaced natural acoustics

### Day 2: Electronics Integration
- 4 hours: Integrating Ableton Live playback with orchestra
- Spatial audio programming for Thorvaldsdottir premiere
- Testing backup systems and fail-safes

### Day 3: Dress Rehearsal
- Full run-through with soloists
- Fine-tuning dynamics and spatial positioning
- Audience simulation (partial seating)

## Performance Execution

### Key Decisions

**Minimal Amplification Philosophy:**
- Only reinforcing what couldn't naturally reach the gallery
- Preserving orchestral blend and timbre
- Electronic elements clearly present but not overpowering

**Spatial Audio:**
- 8-channel system created immersive dome for Thorvaldsdottir
- Panning choreographed with score
- Smooth transitions between acoustic orchestra and spatial electronics

**Dynamic Preservation:**
- Maintained orchestral pppp dynamics (extremely quiet passages)
- Protected powerful climaxes from distortion
- Natural crescendos without compression artifacts

## Technical Achievements

- **Seamless integration** of live orchestra with 8-channel electronics
- **Zero technical issues** during performance (full redundancy planning)
- **Critical acclaim** for sound quality (reviewed in The Guardian)
- **Broadcast recording** mixed simultaneously for BBC Radio 3

## Challenges Overcome

**Royal Albert Hall Acoustics:**
- 2.3-second reverb time required careful timing of reinforcement
- Echo under dome managed through speaker positioning and delays
- Gallery coverage achieved without feedback issues

**Complex Spatial Piece:**
- Real-time mixing of 8 independent channels during world premiere
- Coordinating with composer's vision (present at rehearsals)
- Technical backup for all spatial processing

**Extreme Dynamic Range:**
- Maintaining clarity in quietest passages without raising noise floor
- Protecting loudest moments while preserving impact
- No limiting on main orchestral buses (only safety limiters)

## Team

- **FOH Engineer:** Your Name
- **Monitor Engineer:** James Patterson
- **System Tech:** Sarah Williams (d&b audiotechnik)
- **Stage Manager:** Royal Albert Hall technical team
- **Broadcast Mix:** BBC Radio 3 team (split from FOH)

## Client Feedback

> "Exceptional work. The balance between orchestra and electronics was perfect, and the spatial audio brought the premiere to life. Professional, creative, and technically flawless." — **Esa-Pekka Salonen, Conductor**

> "The sound engineering was invisible in the best way — enhancing the performance without calling attention to itself." — **LSO Production Manager**

## Press

**The Guardian** (★★★★★):  
*"The sound design was exemplary, with electronics that felt organic rather than imposed."*

**BBC Music Magazine:**  
*"Technically immaculate performance, with spatial audio that transported the audience."*

## Technical Specifications

**Signal Flow:**
- Analog mic inputs → SD7 console → Spatial processing → d&b amplifiers → Speaker arrays
- Redundant Dante network for all critical signals
- Backup console available (SD10)

**Monitoring:**
- Personal in-ear monitors for soloists (Sennheiser 2050)
- Onstage wedges for conductor reference
- Side-fill speakers for orchestra awareness

**Recording:**
- 96-track recording to Pro Tools for archival
- Stereo broadcast mix to BBC
- Binaural recording for VR documentation
