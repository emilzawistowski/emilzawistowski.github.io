## About

Resonance Collective is an experimental electronic music project exploring the intersection of algorithmic composition, spatial audio, and live improvisation. Founded in 2021, the project combines modular synthesis, field recordings, and live coding to create immersive sonic experiences.

The project draws inspiration from ambient, techno, and electroacoustic music traditions, using custom software tools and hardware setups to generate evolving soundscapes that respond to acoustic environments and audience interaction.
