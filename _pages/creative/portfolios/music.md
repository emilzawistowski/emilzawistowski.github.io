This portfolio showcases my work as an electronic music artist and performer. I create experimental electronic music combining modular synthesis, algorithmic composition, and spatial audio, with a focus on immersive live performance and studio production.

## Artistic Identity

**Resonance Collective** is my primary musical project, exploring the intersection of:
- **Algorithmic composition** and generative systems
- **Spatial audio** and multichannel performance
- **Modular synthesis** and analog sound sources
- **Field recordings** and environmental sound

The music draws from ambient, techno, and electroacoustic traditions while developing a distinctive voice through custom software tools, unconventional synthesis techniques, and site-specific performances.

## Discography

### Albums

**Echoes** (2023) — XYZ Records  
Full-length album exploring themes of memory and temporal perception. Features layered synthesizer textures, processed field recordings, and algorithmic composition. 

*Reviews:*
- Pitchfork: 7.8/10
- The Wire: "A stunning achievement in contemporary electronic music"
- Resident Advisor: 4/5

### EPs & Singles

**Fragments** (2022) — Self-Released  
Five-track EP focusing on granular synthesis and micro-temporal structures.

**Drift** (2021) — Self-Released  
Debut single featuring generative synthesis and spatial audio processing.

## Live Performance

### Performance Approach

Live sets combine:
- **Modular synthesizers** (Eurorack system)
- **Samplers & sequencers** (Octatrack, Analog Rytm)
- **Custom software** (Max/MSP, SuperCollider patches)
- **Spatial audio** (quadraphonic, ambisonic when possible)

Performances are largely improvised within structured frameworks, creating unique experiences for each audience while maintaining compositional coherence.

### Notable Performances (2022-2024)

**Major Festivals:**
- Mutek Montreal (2024) — Commissioned performance
- Unsound Krakow (2024) — Site-specific salt mine performance
- Atonal Berlin (2023) — A/V collaboration
- CTM Festival Berlin (2023) — Experimental showcase

**Club Shows:**
- Berghain (Berlin) — Album release, January 2024
- Fabric (London) — Supporting international artist
- Tresor (Berlin) — Multiple appearances
- About Blank (Berlin) — Extended improvisation sets

**International:**
- 15+ European cities (Berlin, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Warsaw)
- Canada, USA festival bookings (2024)

## Artistic Statement

My work investigates how electronic systems can generate musical meaning through emergence and interaction. I'm interested in:

- **Temporal Perception** — How rhythmic and tonal patterns shape our sense of time
- **Spatial Hearing** — Using multichannel audio to create immersive sonic environments
- **Algorithmic Beauty** — Finding musicality in computational processes
- **Organic Electronics** — Making synthesizers and computers feel alive and responsive

I strive to create music that is both intellectually engaging and emotionally resonant, bridging experimental and accessible approaches to electronic sound.
