I work as a sound engineer and radio host based in Copenhagen, creating sonic experiences across live performance, recording, and broadcast contexts.

## Practice Areas

My creative work encompasses multiple roles and contexts:

- **Sound Engineering** — live sound for concerts and DJ sets, studio recording, technical audio production
- **Post-Production** — audio editing, mixing, and mastering for film, video, podcasts, and multimedia projects
- **Radio & Podcasts** — hosting radio shows, podcast production, audio storytelling
- **Music Production** — electronic music composition, synthesis, sound design, and creative audio projects
