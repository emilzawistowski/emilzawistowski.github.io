I work as a sound engineer, composer, and performer, creating and facilitating sonic experiences across live performance, studio recording, installation, and club contexts. My practice spans technical precision and creative exploration.

## Practice Areas

My creative work encompasses multiple roles and contexts:

- **Sound Engineering** — live sound reinforcement, studio recording, and technical audio production for concerts, events, and recordings
- **Post-Production** — audio editing, mixing, and mastering for film, video, podcasts, and multimedia projects
- **Music & Performance** — electronic music composition, live performance, and collaborative musical projects
- **DJ Work** — DJ performances, mix creation, and engagement with club culture and electronic music
