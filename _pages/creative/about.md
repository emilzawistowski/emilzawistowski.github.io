## Bio

I am a sound engineer and radio host based in Copenhagen, working in live sound, recording, and post-production. My work spans concerts, DJ sets, podcasts, and film audio.

I host two radio shows on Radio Kapitał exploring psychoacoustics, music philosophy, and significant music labels. I also work as a freelance sound engineer for live performances and post-production projects.

## Philosophy & Approach

### On Sound Engineering
Great sound engineering serves the music and the moment. Whether mixing a concert or producing a podcast, the goal is to create an optimal listening experience that honors the artist's vision.

### On Creative Work
My creative practice explores the boundaries between composition and improvisation, acoustic and electronic sound. I'm interested in how computational systems can generate musical meaning and how listening can be an active practice.

### On Community
Sound exists in shared spaces and collective experiences. Through radio shows, festival volunteering, and collaborative projects, I aim to contribute to audio communities and share knowledge.

### On Craft
Whether engineering a concert, mixing a podcast, or performing, I approach every project with preparation and attention to detail.
