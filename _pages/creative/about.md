## Bio

I am a sound artist, engineer, and electronic music producer working across live performance, studio production, post-production, and installation. My practice spans technical precision and creative exploration, bringing together skills in audio engineering, music composition, and sonic experimentation.

Based in Berlin, I work as a freelance sound engineer for concerts and events, post-production mixer for film and video, and electronic music artist performing under the name Resonance Collective. My creative work investigates spatial audio, algorithmic composition, and the relationship between sound and environment.

I'm committed to fostering community through sound, whether through teaching workshops, producing podcasts, organizing listening events, or supporting emerging artists. My approach balances professional rigor with experimental spirit, always seeking new ways to engage with sound and listening.

## Philosophy & Approach

### On Sound Engineering
I believe great sound engineering is invisible — it serves the music and the moment without drawing attention to itself. Whether mixing a classical orchestra or a techno live PA, the goal is to create an optimal listening experience that honors the artist's vision and connects with the audience.

### On Creative Work
My creative practice explores the boundaries between composition and improvisation, control and emergence, acoustic and electronic. I'm interested in how computational systems can generate musical meaning, how space shapes sound perception, and how listening can be an active, transformative practice.

### On Community
Sound is inherently social — it exists in shared spaces and collective experiences. I'm committed to building community through teaching, collaboration, and creating opportunities for others. The audio world has given me so much; sharing knowledge and supporting others is essential.

### On Craft
Whether engineering a concert, mixing a film, or performing live, I approach every project with professionalism, preparation, and openness to the unexpected. Technical excellence and creative exploration aren't opposites — they support each other.
