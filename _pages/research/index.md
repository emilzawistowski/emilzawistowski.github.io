I am a Master's student in Sound and Music Computing at Aalborg University (Copenhagen), researching auditory perception, spatial audio, and computational sound analysis. My work combines experimental psychoacoustics with audio signal processing and machine learning.

## Current Research Focus

My research explores auditory perception and audio technology:

- **Spatial Audio Perception** — investigating perceptual and acoustic features of spatial audio formats
- **Auditory Cognition** — spatial hearing, auditory object enumeration, auditory salience
- **Computational Audio** — machine learning for audio analysis, acoustic feature extraction
- **Music Cognition** — psychoacoustics and cognitive aspects of music perception
