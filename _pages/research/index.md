I am a researcher in sound and music computing, specializing in psychoacoustics, spatial audio perception, and audio signal processing. My work combines experimental methods, computational modeling, and software development to understand and enhance how we perceive and interact with sound.

## Current Research Focus

My research explores the intersection of human auditory perception and computational audio systems:

- **Spatial Audio Perception** — investigating how listeners perceive and localize sound sources in virtual and augmented environments
- **Psychoacoustic Modeling** — developing computational models of auditory perception for audio applications
- **Audio Signal Processing** — creating algorithms and tools for spatial audio rendering, analysis, and manipulation
