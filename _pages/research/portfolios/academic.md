This portfolio showcases my academic research in sound and music computing, with focus on auditory perception, spatial audio, and computational audio analysis.

## Research Interests

My research investigates auditory perception and audio technology:

- **Auditory Perception** — Spatial hearing, auditory object enumeration, auditory salience, auditory scene analysis
- **Spatial Audio** — Perceptual and acoustic analysis of spatial audio formats, binaural audio
- **Computational Audio** — Machine learning for audio analysis, acoustic feature extraction, signal processing
- **Music Cognition** — Psychoacoustics, auditory memory, perceptual aspects of music

## Selected Publications
