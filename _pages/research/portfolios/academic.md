This portfolio showcases my academic research in sound and music computing, with particular focus on psychoacoustics, spatial audio perception, and computational modeling of auditory perception.

## Research Interests

My research investigates the intersection of human auditory perception and computational audio systems:

- **Psychoacoustics** — Understanding the perceptual processes underlying spatial hearing, timbre perception, and auditory scene analysis
- **Spatial Audio** — Developing and evaluating binaural rendering techniques, HRTF individualization methods, and spatial audio for VR/AR
- **Computational Modeling** — Creating psychoacoustically-informed models for audio applications and perceptual quality prediction
- **Experimental Methods** — Designing and conducting rigorous listening experiments with statistical analysis
