## Bio

I am a researcher in sound and music computing with focus on psychoacoustics, spatial audio perception, and audio signal processing. My work investigates how humans perceive and interact with sound in virtual and augmented environments, combining experimental psychoacoustics, computational modeling, and software development.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the University of Sound and Music Computing, where my dissertation explores psychoacoustic modeling of spatial audio perception in virtual reality environments. My research aims to bridge the gap between perceptual research and practical audio applications, developing computational models that improve immersive audio experiences.

I am committed to open science principles, sharing research code, data, and tools through open-source platforms. My software projects have been adopted by researchers and developers worldwide, contributing to advances in spatial audio technology.
