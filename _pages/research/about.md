## Bio

I am a Master's student in Sound and Music Computing at Aalborg University (Copenhagen), focusing on auditory perception, spatial audio, and computational sound analysis. My research combines experimental psychoacoustics with audio signal processing and machine learning.

I completed a Bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science at the University of Warsaw, where I studied auditory perception and music cognition. During my undergraduate studies, I co-founded the Research Circle of Cognitive Psychology of Music and conducted experimental research on spatial hearing and auditory object enumeration.

I also work as a sound engineer, with experience in live sound, recording, and post-production. This practical work with audio technology informs my research perspective.
